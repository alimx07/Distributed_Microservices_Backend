## Project Overview
This repository is a practical microservices backend.

Core goals:
- Build a small but realistic system with multiple services, different stacks and techs(caches , DBs , Queus), and pragmatic trade-offs.
- Push it to Kubernetes later, and observe it end-to-end with Prometheus/Grafana.
- Testing the system using K6, measure it, and fix real bottlenecks.
